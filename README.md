# Python

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed for learning and practicing Python programming. It is intended to serve both beginners and intermediate learners who wish to understand general Python programming concepts and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The content includes comprehensive examples, explanations, and exercises that can be run interactively.

## Notebooks

The repository contains the following notebooks:

* **BasicPython\_main.ipynb**: An introduction to core Python programming concepts, such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and modules. This notebook includes code examples and explanations that cover Python syntax and fundamental features.
* **OopPython\_main.ipynb**: A focused tutorial on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. It covers classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, demonstrating how to define classes and use OOP techniques to structure code.
* **Oop\_practice.ipynb**: A set of practice exercises and problems designed to reinforce OOP concepts. Users can apply what they've learned by working through these exercises, which include real-world examples and step-by-step solutions.

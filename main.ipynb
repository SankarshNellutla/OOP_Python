    "\n",
    "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which bundle data (attributes) and code (methods).  \n",
    "OOP helps organize code, promotes reusability, and models real-world entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main OOP concepts:**\n",
    "- **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "- **Object**: Instance of a class.\n",
    "- **Attribute**: Variable that belongs to an object or class.\n",
    "- **Method**: Function that belongs to a class.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Mechanism to create new classes from existing ones.\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Using a common interface for different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the main Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python:\n",
    "- Class and Object\n",
    "- Class Variables\n",
    "- Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)\n",
    "- Abstract Classes\n",
